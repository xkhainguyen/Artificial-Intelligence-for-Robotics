## CS373: Artificial Intelligence for Robotics | Programming a Robotic Car
### A Udacity Course instructed by Sebastian Thrun

### Course Description
Learn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving teams. This class provides the gist of many essential robotic stacks, including: probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking and control. Along with insightful lectures, there are many interesting problems and a challenging final project.

This course is offered as part of the Georgia Tech Masters in Computer Science. The updated course includes a final project, where you must chase a runaway robot that is trying to escape!

Below are some pictures (some are animations) from my programs:

1. Navigating through a maze by A* planning, path smoothing, and PID controller (twiddling for the best control parameters)

2. Similar setup, adding particle filter to deal with measurement noise

There are detailed comments in each program, please ask if you are not clear.
